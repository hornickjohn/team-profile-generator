## Description

This CLI will recursively prompt the user through the process of providing information for as many team members as desired, and then create and save a formatted HTML file displaying this info and providing links to email and github accounts.

## Installation

Clone the repository [here](https://github.com/hornickjohn/team-profile-generator), and while in its directory run "npm i" to install dependencies.

## Usage

Run "node index.js" from the command line within this directory. You will then be run through a sequence of prompts where you will provide information for each team member, until you are finished and select "Nope, Team Finished!" After the application has exited, look in the /dist directory and run 'profiles.html' to see the formatted webpage with your team's information.

## Tests

After installing dependencies, 'npm test' will run testing in jest.
